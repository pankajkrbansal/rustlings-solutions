# Rustlings Solutions ðŸ¦€
The Rustlings Solution Repository contains the solutions to the exercises found in the Rustlings repository for tag **5.4.0**. Rustlings is a collection of exercises designed to help you learn Rust programming language. This repository provides solutions to the Rustlings exercises and is intended to be used as a reference for learners who are stuck or want to compare their solutions with others.

To use this repository, simply navigate to the exercise you are interested in and look for the corresponding solution file. The solutions are organized in directories that correspond to the exercises in the Rustlings repository. Each solution file contains commented code that explains the solution and how it works.

It is recommended that you attempt to complete the exercises in the Rustlings repository on your own before referring to the solutions in this repository. The best way to learn Rust is through hands-on practice and experimentation. However, if you are stuck or need help, this repository can provide guidance and a reference for how to solve the exercises.

If you have a better solution to any of the exercises, or if you find a bug in an existing solution, please feel free to open a pull request with your changes.

Happy learning!
